## Introduction

![introduction](/ruleset/ressources/list-introduction.excalidraw.png)

Modern armies operate quite different than world war 2 armies, even if just
for the fact that we dont have several million active soldiers in service (the
german army saw about 13 million soldiers serve in 36 divisions).

Today, a single brigade, batallion or even company can be much more diverse in
its equipment and attachments. Many companies have organic fire support or weapon
systems (meaning the systems actually belong to the formation). Furthermore,
specialized units are added to a larger formation to reinforce them. They serve them
as force multipliers, such as engineers, anti-air systems or artillery, which are
often trained and stationed in their own batallions, but are deployed as
platoons or units in another formation.

To illustrate this without being too nitpicky, we use 3 basic roster as our base
army lists. We have the light infantry platoon, which is fields heaps of infantry,
and lots of fire support. Following that comes the armoured infantry platoon, which has
a focus on the combined arms approach of AFVs with infantry and more hard-hitting
options. Lastly, the armoured platoon, which fields tanks and supporting vehicles.

Some armies may also provide more specific rosters for their respective lists,
since even most conventional armies can have huge differences in their structure,
sometimes for historical reasons, sometimes due to a different focus or approach
to warfare.

## NATO symbology

Since we have a whole arrange of unit types which need to somehow fit into a
generic list, this ruleset uses the standard NATO military symbols as described
[here](https://www.cimic-coe.org/resources/external-publications/app-6-c.pdf). But to save you from reading a 500+ pages NATO document, here is a
quick summary of all you need to know:

### Formation marker

Any formation can be displayed as a symbol on a map, with size, capability,
type of unit and many other information that is usually interesting, but which
we can ignore. We only really need to understand the frame, icon and modifier.

</p>

Shown above are the basic frames for formations we use in this ruleset. As you
can see, just by its shape we can dissern whether a unit is friendly or not, and
whether its a ground- or airborne unit. To further differentiate between unit
types we can add icons to the body. Here are the most important ones:

</p>

Many units have modifiers added to their frames, but you really only need to know
these to understand what a unit is at its core.

### Equipment marker

In many cases, the focus of a unit is more on the equipment than the formation.
These icons show a singular mortar, machine gun, howitzer, tank or other vehicle.
The marker itself is round and has the familier icon and modfier placement.

</p>

Some icons also show the type of propulsion below the icon, in the form of wheels
or tracks. They indicate, whether the equipment piece is towed or more often just
a vehicle.

## Generic lists

All lists try to be as generic as possible and use basic unit and equipment markers.
Most slots are also subdiveded in the army lists by their headers, so e. g. all
machine guns are in the "machine gun" section, infantry in the "Infantry" section,
and so on.

The platoon consists of the mandatory units in white and additional units in
reddish-beige (mauve?). The white line on the left differentiates the upper core
part of the platoon, where you may fill slots without any restriction.

The lower part, as described in blue, are the reinforcing attachments.
They come from other companies or battalions and can be selected as additions, but
only two rows per platoon are allowed. Once a row is chosen, you can use any or all
slots of its row.

### Light infantry platoon

The light infantry platoon has a focus on lots of infantry with a large pool of
support options. While no heavy options are available, light infantry platoons
get more units per attachment.

### Armoured infantry platoon

Armoured infantry consists of a a mix of IFVs with mounted infantry and a range
of attachments. While not as many options are available as to light infantry,
armoured infantry platoons are able to attach heavy systems such as tanks or
helicopters, and still field enough organic infantry to engage any threat.
