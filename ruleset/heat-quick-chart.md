## Movement

### Vehicle movement

| Vehicle Type | ADVANCE<br>(Pivots) | RUN<br>(Pivots) |
| :--- | ---- | ---- |
| Wheeled | 12" (2) | 24" (1) |
| Multi-axial wheeled | 12" (1) | 24" (0) |
| Tracked | 9" (1) | 18" (0) |

On-Road bonus still doubles range.

#### Quad bikes

| Rule | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Quad Bikes | Unit mounts for faster deployment. Move as a wheeled vehicle without<br>on road bonus. Can be chosen as an upgrade to a unit if available in unit options.<br>Removed once disembarked. |

### Helicopter movement

Lift-Off and Landing require the helicopter to perform a successful order test
as well and are performed to/from 6" height (always measured from bottom of hull).

The minimum flight height is 6", the maximum is 30".

Horizontal movement works the same as normal vehicle movement. The helicopter can
move either only horizontally, which is faster, or change its altitude as well.

| Type | Horizontal<br>(RUN) | Horizontal<br>(ADVANCE) | Vertical<br>(RUN) | Vertical<br>(ADVANCE) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| **Light/Medium** | 48" (1) | 24" (2) | 20" (1) | 10" (2) |
| **Large/Giant** | 24" (0) | 12" (1) | 10" (0) | 5" (1) |

## Helicopters

### FUBAR chart

Attacking a helicopter works the same way as any other vehicle, and if hit, has
to check against the following chart:

| FUBAR Value | Effect |
| :--: | :--- |
| <=1 | <li>+D2 pin marker to helicopter crew.</li><li>The unit goes DOWN.</li><li>If the helicopter has a rotating weapon, roll for turret jam.</li> |
| 2-3 | <li>+D3 pin marker to helicopter crew. </li><li>The unit goes DOWN.</li><li>Severe damage to the vehicle leads to a reduction in movement<br> speed by half, except downwards movements.</li><li>If the helicopter has a rotating weapon, roll for turret jam.</li> |
| +4 |<li>The helicopter is considered destroyed.</li><li>It crashes 3D6 in a random direction, where it causes an explosion (HE 2").</li><li>Any passengers are considered destroyed.</li> |
