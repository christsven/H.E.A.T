# "Frequently" asked questions

Nobody asked me anything, this is just stuff people might be bothered by. If you
actually have a question, let me know, and i'll probably add it here.

## Units and Lists

### Why do the lists sometimes use specific sub-units (e.g. recons, engineers) and sometimes categories (e.g. infantry, combat support)?

That way you have the choice of adding more units of one specialty compared to
fewer, more general support assets. I also felt like this would be more realistic
in some cases, as you seldomly will see a singular infantry or engineer squad
reinforcing a platoon (not that they would be reinforcing a platoon anyway,
i think that happens mostly on the company level.)

So this way its a bit more nuanced without having a dozen subcategories and overcomplicating things.

### Why do some drones use the rectangle ground unit symbol, and some the air vehicle image?

Units that use the rectangle icon have on map operators, so they are a "ground unit",
while off map operated drones are just air vehicles. So that is one way to quickly
identify which is which.

### Where are the command vehicles?

Command vehicles are not separate vehicles, you can find the option in many of
the APC/IFV vehicles or even some transports. If taken as a command vehicle, they
no longer block their former vehicle slot in the platoon list, but the command unit
slot.

## Ruleset questions

### Why does [X] still use the same stats/range/PEN as in Bolt Action, even though they are so much more powerful?

First of all, because the gameflow of BA is solid and I didnt want to change that.
But also I think its not even that far fetched, as the PEN or armour in BA is always
relative to each other. So if we have a "medium" tank, that means it is classified
as such compared to other tanks of its era. And in  the end, if everything gets
stronger, nothing really gets buffed as a result, since the relative strengths
even out.

### Why is [X] formatted so weirdly in my browser?

I mostly write this ruleset to be viewed in the Github App or in a mobile browser,
as we use that when we play, so spacing and tables are formatted to work on a
mobile screen. I hope that for the most part, that still works in a web browser.

### Why are the images all off-white?

Github and the App both are dark-mode by default, so thats what I drew the images
for. Sadly, I cant just export them in black and show that for light mode users,
so you either have to use dark mode as well or stick to the images as they are.

If I find another solution for that, I will change it.

### What are the sources for the traced images?

I am currently assembling a list of every image I traced with a source to the artist,
which I will add as its own section. You can find that [here](/ruleset/sources.md).
