# H.E.A.T

## Introduction

This is a ruleset for a modern, platoon-sized tabletop wargame. While size- and
modelagnostic, weapon ranges and distances are balanced towards a 28mm size. If
used in another scale, adjustments might be necessary.

## Weapons

These weapons are operated by a single unit, which uses it as its primary weapon.

### Adjustments

#### Weapon choice

Since modern infantry structures and their weapon arsenal are not as restricted
as they were in the second world war, instead of only providing a choice of a
few SMGs next to a bunch of rifles and paying more points for them, the way
units choose their weapons is changed.

Now a squad has a base weapon for each soldier and deviating from that weapon
costs 3 points. This applies to **ARs**, **SMGs**, **PDWs** and **shotguns**.

A squad can change out none, a couple or even all their weapons, and we count the
logistical strain by adding up the points, since we don't really have that much
of a buff anymore by using SMGs. It's much more about the role the unit is supposed
to fulfill.
