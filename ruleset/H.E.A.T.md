# H.E.A.T

## Introduction

This is a ruleset for a modern, platoon-sized tabletop wargame. While size- and
modelagnostic, weapon ranges and distances are balanced towards a 28mm size. If
used in another scale, adjustments might be necessary.

As a note: modern vehicles for 28mm are often scaled to "true" size, which is 1/50 in relation to the miniatures. While I personally dont care about size too much, it is noticable on the table if you mix up a 1/56 M113 next to a 1/50 or even 1/48 M1 Abrams. Just a heads up, so you wont be too surprised when the "28mm" vehicles suddenly turn out way bigger than most WW2 era vehicles.

## Weapons

These weapons are operated by a single unit, which uses it as its primary weapon.

## Gameplay Rules

### Vehicles

#### IFVs

##### Introduction

With the advancements of tank engines in the first world war tanks started to
outpace theinfantry it was trying to catch up to. As a result, half-tracks and
other armoured personnel carriers (APC) became widespread. After the war, these
mostly unarmed vehicles grew into a more interconnected role with the infantry
they were transporting, giving rise to mechanized infantry, who fight in
conjunction with their carrier. This type of carrier, mostly armed with at least
a 20mm autocannon or ATGM systems, are called infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs).

##### Mechanics

The IFV combines transport capabilities with a combat role. Since they work
extensively interconnected with the infantry they carry, the NCO role of the
infantry group is filled by the IFV itself.

The infantry group and the IFV are still two different units, but they are
"connected" to each other; an IFV cannot be deployed without a connected infantry
group.

If the infantry unit is destroyed, the IFV does not need to be removed and serves
as a normal vehicle. If the connected unit is separated by more than 36" from its
carrier, a pin is added to any order test performed.

##### IFV rule

| Rule | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| IFV | <li>The IFV is connected to the first or second mandatory infantry<br> unit, if applicable. Otherwise it serves just as a normal unit.</li><li>Vehicle stays as a separate unit.</li><li>It replaces the NCO of the infantry group.</li><li>If connected infantry is further than 30" away, they have to perform<br> an order test for any action. This does not apply to the vehicle.</li> |

#### Helicopters

##### Introduction

Helicopters are another post-WW2 addition to all conventional ground forces.
Capable over hovering and vertical liftoff, these crafts are used in logistics,
troop movement, close air support roles and reconnaissance.

##### Gameplay

Helicopters function either as a transport or are deployed in a CAS role, upon
which they lose their troop capacity. Other than their vertical movement capability,
helicopters are treated the same way as any other vehicle.

| Type | Cost | Capacity | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--: | :--: |
| Light helicopters | <table><tr><td>Inexperienced</td><td>35 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Regular</td><td>50 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Veteran</td><td>65 pt</td></tr></table> | 8 | Boeing AH-6<br>MD500<br>Ka-226 |
| Medium helicopters | <table><tr><td>Inexperienced</td><td>50 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Regular</td><td>65 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Veteran</td><td>80 pt</td></tr></table> | 16 | Mil Mi-2<br>Bell UH "Huey" |
| Large helicopters | <table><tr><td>Inexperienced</td><td>65 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Regular</td><td>80 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Veteran</td><td>95 pt</td></tr></table> | 24 | NH90<br>UH-60 "Black Hawk"<br>Mi-24 Hind |
| Giant helicopters | <table><tr><td>Inexperienced</td><td>80 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Regular</td><td>95 pt</td></tr><tr><td>Veteran</td><td>110 pt</td></tr></table> | 36 | Mi-26<br>VH-47 Chinook |

##### Flight

A helicopter may begin the match on the ground or offmap in reserve, from where
it can enter the match at any height after a successful order test.

Lift-Off and Landing require the helicopter to perform a successful order test
as well and are performed to/from 6" height (always measured from bottom of hull).

The minimum flight height is 6", the maximum is 60".

Horizontal movement works the same as normal vehicle movement. The helicopter can
move either vertical or horizontal in a single turn as described below.

| Type | Horizontal<br>(RUN) | Horizontal<br>(ADVANCE) | Horizontal<br>(RUN) | Horizontal<br>(ADVANCE) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| **Light** | 48" (1) | 24" (2) | 20" (2) | 10" (2) |
| **Medium** | 36" (1) | 18" (2) | 20" (2) | 10" (2) |
| **Large** | 24" (0) | 12" (1) | 10" (1) | 5" (2) |
| **Giant** | 20" (0) | 10" (1) | 10" (1) | 5" (2) |

*In Brackets: Allowed 45° turns.*

##### Transport and (Dis)embarking

Every helicopter has a capacity indicating the amount of personell that is able
to be transported.

A landed helicopter can be treated the same way as a normal transport. Take an
order test to embark or disembark. After succesfully leaving the helicopter, unit
get the usual 6" movement in any direction they choose.

A hovering helicopter (not after a RUN) can also rapell units from a height of up
to 20". The unit disembarking needs to be veterans, and the helicopter crew
regulars.

The disembarking units rapell down to the ground, directly below the helicopter.
From there, they also get the 6" move range.

##### Combat

###### Attacking with a helicopter

The helicopter is able to attack anything in 45° arks, distances measured from
the weapon barrels themselves.

![Attack vectors](image.png)

###### Attacking from a helicopter

If the helicopter is hovering (anything except RUN), onboard units are allowed to
"open" rear/side doors and attack with their small arms from there, with a *-2*
*modifier to hit*.

The helicopter gets the "Open Topped" rule while having open rear/side doors. As
soon as the helicoter succesfully performs a RUN order, or the turn is over, the
rule does no longer apply.

Recon units like spotters are allowed to perform their role from the helicopter
in 45° arks from the opening they are looking from. The door has to be open to
do this.

###### Shooting at a helicopter

Attacking a helicopter works the same way as any other vehicle, and if hit, has
to check against the following chart:

| D6 | Effect |
| :--: | :--- |
| <=1 | <li>+D2 pin marker to helicopter crew.</li><li>The unit goes DOWN.</li><li>If the helicopter has a rotating weapon, roll for turret jam.</li> |
| 2-3 | <li>+D3 pin marker to helicopter crew. </li><li>The unit goes DOWN.</li><li>Severe damage to the vehicle leads to a reduction in movement<br> speed by half, except downwards movements.</li><li>If the helicopter has a rotating weapon, roll for turret jam.</li> |
| +4 |<li>The helicopter is considered destroyed.</li><li>It crashes 3D6 in a random direction, where it causes an explosion (HE 2").</li><li>Any passengers are considered destroyed.</li> |

### Weapon Systems

#### Drones

##### Introduction

Drones are small quadrotor helicopters, often extremely small and capable to be
carried around by hand.

##### Gameplay

The drone operator team (DOT) consists of 1 operator (SMG or PDW) and can be
reinforced by up to 2 attendants (AR/SMG/PDW).

| Veterancy | Cost | Cost<br>attendant |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Inexperienced | 35 pt | 7 pt |
| Regular | 50 pt | 10 pt |
| Veteran | 65 pt | 13 pt |

 As soon as either the drone or the operator is lost, the DOT is considered
 destroyed.

The UAV uses the same damage value as its team.

##### Movement

They can be suspended at any height below 2' (60cm).

Per activation, either the operator or the UAV can perform an action.

The UAV is able to move in 30" (RUN)/ 15" (ADVANCE) in any direction.

It can stay airbound for 2 consecutive rounds before potentially losing battery
charge:

![drone battery image](image-1.png)

The UAV can be recovered by the DOT by moving within 1" of the grounded drone.

If turn ends with the grounded UAV closer to enemy forces than friendly ones, it
is considered destroyed.

The battery pack is reset every time the DOT is within 1" of the grounded UAV.

##### Range

Similar to the battery pack, the range of an airborne UAV is limited by the wire-
less connection range to the DOT.

If the UAV ends its turn more than 60" away from the DOT, upon activation the
following test has to be passed:

![drone range image](image-2.png)

##### Variants

###### Reconaissance

Enables capable of spotting enemy targets in direct LoS.

Can commicate with any unit within the DOTs platoon or any unit capable of indirect
fire in 12" around the DOT, once per turn.

The communication does require or use up an activation, but is blocked if the
DOT is DOWN.

###### IED (+10 pt)

The UAV carries an improvised high explosive with it, capable of being dropped
on enemy units:

![ied drop image](image-3.png)

Upon dropping the payload, the UAV can be recovered by the DOT to be rearmed,
which takes a successful RALLY order.

###### AT IED (+25 pt)

The UAV carries a powerful AT warhead instead of a HE round.

![at ied drop image](image-4.png)

Upon dropping the payload, the UAV can be recovered by the DOT to be rearmed,
which takes a successful RALLY order.

##### Drone rule

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Drone | -1 hit modifier while airborne<br>-2 if airborne plus RUN as last active order<br>Unit is connected via a wireless connection to the operator |

****

#### Anti-Tank guided missiles (ATGM)

##### Introduction

Anti-Tank guided missiles are stationary AT weapons, capable of effectively
engaging any armoured target over several kilometers. They are most often wire-
guided, thus being able to strike targets which move after deployment.

This places the system operator at a risk of being attacked while the missile is still mid-air.

##### Gameplay

Any ATGM team consists of 1 system operators (SMG or PDW) + 2 loader (SMG or PDW).

| Veterancy | Cost |
| ---- | ---- |
| Inexperienced | 60 pt |
| Regular | 85 pt |
| Veteran | 110 pt |

ATGM groups are treated the same way as any other team weapon.

##### ATGM rule

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ATGM | <li>ATGMs can be fired at any vehicle in its LoS, but the missile requires some time to<br>approach targets at greater distances.</li><li>Any vehicle in the ATGMs LoS can be targeted, regardless of distance to target.</li><li>Upon firing, the missile approaches the target in a straight line at 32" per turn.</li><li>If the target ends the turn out of LoS or the ATGM operator unit goes DOWN<br>or moves, the missile is destroyed.</li> |

##### Special rules

****

#### Underbarrel grenade launchers (UGL)

****

#### Tandem HEAT charges

##### Introduction

Heavier versions of the usual AT rocket propelled grenades. While having a more limited range due to a larger and heavier configuration, the multiple stages of detonation provided by a Tandem HEAT round are capable of striking through moddrn reactive armour and heavy defenses.

##### Gameplay

Most RPGs have an option to be equipped with Tandem HEAT rounds. They do not replace the normal RPG round,giving you the option of using both. Before attacking, announce which type is used by the system operator. Attacks are performed the same way as any normal RPG attack.

PEN values and range as seen in the weapons chart.

##### Rule

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tandem HEAT Charge | Optional Upgrade for most RPGs. If chosen and selected for an attack, announce before roling to hit. Damage values and range as seen in weapons chart. |

****

#### Light anti-tank weapons (LAW)

##### Introduction

LAWs are lightweight, fire and forget AT rockets. They are fired from a disposable missile launch platform. These weapons are issued at squad-level and provide normal infantry units with anti-tank capabilizies.

##### Rule

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| LAW | Fires a single AT warhead against any vehicle. An attack is performed the same way as a normal attack against a vehicle, e. g. with an RPG. PEN value as seen in weapons chart. Single-Use, once fired, the weapon is no longer available.|

****

#### Designated Marksmen (DMR)

****

#### Improvised explosive devices (IED)

****

##### Sappers

#### Automatic grenade launchers (AGL)

****

#### Manportable air defense systems (MANPADS)

****

#### Bangalores

****

#### Smoke Screens

##### Introduction

Modern vehicles are equopped with smoke grenade laumchers to quickly provide cover in case of an emergency situation. They are forward facing and enable maneuvering and retreat if necessary.

##### Gameplay

Once per vehicle, a unit equipped with a smoke screen can active it by going DOWN. (You dont activate with the DOWN, it can be performed without using up the smoke screen, but using it leads to your vehicle to go DOWN.

The smoke screen consists of two 2" smoke markers which are placed in front of the vehicle.

The smoke behaves the same as any other smoke, drifting and vanishing just like a smoke round.

## Additional Rules and Systems

### Adjustments

#### Weapon choice

Since modern infantry structures and their weapon arsenal are not as restricted
as they were in the second world war, instead of only providing a choice of a
few SMGs next to a bunch of rifles and paying more points for them, the way
units choose their weapons is changed.

Now a squad has a base weapon for each soldier and deviating from that weapon
costs 3 points. This applies to **ARs**, **SMGs**, **PDWs** and **shotguns**. 

A pistol can be used, which returns 3 points, since its a step back.

A squad can change out none, a couple or even all their weapons, and we count the
logistical strain by adding up the points, since we don't really have that much
of a buff anymore by using SMGs. It's much more about the role the unit is supposed
to fulfill.

#### Spotters

Since modern forces use raduos extensively on squad-, platoon- and up to battalion-level, any spotter can spot for any gun in his platoon, just like a UAV spots for its entire platoon. 

There is still an option for any gun to bring a designated spotter, since you are still allowed to field multiple spotters, but it is not mandatory.

If a gun has begun zeroing in on a position, it is not bound to a specific spotter. If they went from 6 to 4 on spotter A and spotter B takes over due to A dying or repositioning, the zeroing is not affected. But without a spotter correcting shots, it is also unable to further zero in and lower its value. A direct hit also needs to be observed to notify the artillery that zeroing has finished.
