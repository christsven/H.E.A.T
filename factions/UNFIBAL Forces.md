UNFIBAL was one of the first major parties to the conflict and already assisted estonian
authorities prior to the war. Initially, it fielded older equipment from donor nations
and its soldiers came from a plathora of nations, mostly Asia and Africa, as it is often
the case in UN missions.

After not joining in the NATO mission to Estonia, the US send a hefty amount of new
equipment to the mission in order to save face. The aid package included M1117 Guardians,
Strykers, Bradleys, and even Blackhawks. The white paintjob on the usually prominently
black helicopter earned it the nickname "peace doves" by estonians.

## Army modifiers

### Minimal attrition

UN Peacekeepers are meant to serve as a deescalatory force aiding police
work and opening dialogue. That means that certain weapon systems are not required
to fulfill every role they serve in a conventional army.

To reduce potential collateral damage, heavy weapons do not carry HE shells,
since they are only meant to engage targets that pose a direct threat without 
destroying the area those threats occupy.

_TLDR: AT guns and autocannons do not get HE shells and may only use the PEN value when engaging enemies._

### Minimal casualties

To reduce combat fatalities, most patrols or other operations expecting combat
field a high amount of field medics.

_TLDR: Every infantry group may replace one soldier by a field medic for +30pt._

| Rule | Description | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Team Medic | One soldier is replaced by a medic. The medic obeys standard medic rules<br>for its squad and any friendly unit within 6" of the squad. | +30pt |

### Maximal support

To counterbalance the missing HE rounds, a UN fields more support weaponry
than comparable formations.

_TLDR: When using a default platoon roster, UN platoons may reinforce the platoon with a third one of the optional rows._

## Infantry

![infantry]()

### Reconnaissance squad

### Patrol squad

Oftentimes deployed as smaller teams, UNFIBAL operators helped estonian authorities
to police Ida-Viru when the local forces where too thinly manned. From impromptu checkpoints,
city patrols, force projection to raids, patrol squads are agile formations for a
diverse set of roles.

### Light infantry squad

Well-equipped group of soldiers for foot missions, oftentimes used for combat patrols
or to reinforce and protect local infrastructure.

### Mechanized infantry squad

Vehicle-mounted infantry that deploys in conjunction with an IFV.

### Quick Reaction Squad

Helicopter-mounted infantry, highly mobile to quickly deploy to crisis situation.

### Local reserve force squad

Integrated estonian reserve formations that directly aid the peacekeeping
mission as local guides and translators.
