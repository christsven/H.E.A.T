## Army modifiers

### Cavalry Training

Units in this Brigade are specifically trained to be deployed by helicopter.
Combat landings and disembarking are the norm. Due to this training, regulars
are allowed to disembark by rapelling, and any failed order test to leave a
helicopter may be rerolled.

*TLDR: Regs are allowed to rapell, reroll failed helicopter disembark order tests*

### Forest dwellers

These units are trained for deep incursions and traversal of the bogs and
marches of the Baltics. What is a specialization for other forces is here normal. 
Any infantry group is allowed to get the following rule at 2pt/u:

<table><tr><td>Recon training</td><td>These soldiers are trained to operate and maneuver<br> in even the toughest terrain.<br><br>When using an ADVANCE to move through rough<br>terrain, throw a D2, and on a positive result the team<br>may instead use the RUN distance.</td></table>
