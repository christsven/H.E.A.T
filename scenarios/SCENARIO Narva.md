## Scenario introduction

### 2012 - Declining baltics

Several years of disinformation campaigns, civil unrest due to declining living
standards, and a feeling of being left out by the more ethnically estonian west
counties lead to the rise of extremist sentiment in the more eastern counties
of Estonia. As a former soviet republic, many older, russian-born citizens
remember the USSR in a positive light and see the westernization of society as
a mistake. Most of them live right at the border with Russia, for example in
the city of Narva (95.7% native russian speakers, 87.7% ethnic russians), right
at the border.

### 2014 - Steadfast Jazz Disaster

While tensions brew over the years, a far-right, nationalist movement consisting
of former Red Army soldiers, communist politicians and a growing disillusioned
voter base formed the *"Iseseisvus rahvale"* movement. This group was a vocal
minority in local politics seeking independence from Estonia to form a socialist
republic under a Sowjet in Narva.

The movement gained an influx in supporters and recognition after a military
excercise called "Steadfast Jazz" in November of 2013 lead to the crash of a
french Mirage F1 in a village with a civilian losses, an ethnically russian
farmer. The lackluster response of authorities and NATO commands belatedly
response, at first refusing to halt the maneuver, lead to a PR disaster for
NATO, fueling anti-west sentiment.
