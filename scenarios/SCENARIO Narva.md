## Scenario introduction

This is the first setting for H.E.A.T. as a modern, but fictional war in
northern europe. If you play this just as a unit roster for an army, a single
match, or a full campaign is up to you.

### Iseseisvus rahvale

- civilan pushback
- wanted democracy
- 2 partners lead revolution
- civil war between partners
- SAF powerful force -> many coups
- coup proofing -> multiple groups keep each oother in check
- coup leader -> person in power
- hemeti -> insurgent leader from rebel forces in discr. area
- south sudan splits apart -> weakened position
- hemetis forces become RSF, next to normal SAF army
- hemetis was "bought" with control over minerals which were sold to neighbours

### Timetable

#### 2012 - Declining baltics

Several years of disinformation campaigns, civil unrest due to declining living
standards, and a feeling of being left out by the more ethnically estonian west
counties lead to the rise of extremist sentiment in the more eastern counties
of Estonia. As a former soviet republic, many older, russian-born citizens
remember the USSR in a positive light and see the westernization of society as
a mistake. Most of them live right at the border with Russia, for example in
the city of Narva (95.7% native russian speakers, 87.7% ethnic russians), right
at the border, many of whom face lower living standards due to not speaking
estonian.

#### 2014 - Steadfast Jazz Disaster

While tensions brew over the years, a far-right, nationalist movement
consisting of former Red Army soldiers, communist politicians and a growing
disillusioned voter base formed the *"Iseseisvus rahvale"* movement. This group
was a vocal minority in local politics seeking independence from Estonia to
form a socialist republic under a Sowjet in Narva.

The movement gained an influx in supporters and recognition after a military
excercise called "Steadfast Jazz" in November of 2013 lead to the crash of a
french Mirage F1 in a village with a civilian losses, an ethnically russian
farmer. The lackluster response of authorities and NATO commands belatedly
response, at first refusing to halt the maneuver, lead to a PR disaster for
NATO, fueling anti-west sentiment.

#### 2015 - Spiraling protests

With reoccuring protests demanding more autonomy and accepting russian as a
state language, civil unrest grew over the course of couple of months in early
2015, while thee refugee crisis fueled conservative populism. First open calls
for independence followed razzias against popular far-right extremists, shortly
before the election of parliament in March. The *"Iseseisvus rahvale"* party
were elected by over 80% of voters in the Ida Viru county during the fraud
allegation ridden election run. After learning about their victory, party
officials announced an independence referendum before the end of the year.
This was sharply condemned by estonian and EU officials, leading to protests
in both Ida Viru and the rest of the country.

First clashes between paramilitary forces and police followed in March and
April. The death of two policemen made global news in early May. The estonian,
lithuanian and latvian presidents called upon the treaty of the european union
to aid against the threat of a civil war, but media outlets were too preoccupied
with the "migrant crisis" in the EU, which overshadowed the event.

A bombing of a military convoi redeploying from an excercise in Sillamäe in
August started a discussion to send peace keeping mission to Estonia.

#### 2016 - Outbreak of war

## Geography

### General Description

<img src="ressources/estonia_prewar.png" style="max-width: 50%">

*Map of Estonia before 19.04.2016*

<img src="ressources/estonia_political_map.png" style="max-width: 50%">

*In the upper right corner, Ida-Viru County.*

Ida Viru lies at the russian-estonian land border as well as the Gulf of
Finland in the north. To the south-east, a large part of the border runs
through Lake Peipsi.

The terrain itself is largely flat with up to 30% composed of mires and bogs.
These areas cover open fields with muddy, almost swampy terrain and waist-high
vegetation. Additionally many small rivers and revines, some artificial, cover
the landscape. While some parts are used for agriculture, there are still vast
swathes of forest and bushlands remaining, also thanks to a nation-wide refores-
tation program. Ida Viru county is the location of several national reserves,
two of the larger and more important ones can be found below.

With the population centres along the northern coast most other parts of the
Ida-Viru are only compromised of small villages, connected by two major roads,
for once the E246 motorway connecting Jõhvi through the forests of Agusalu
national reserve with several larger villages and along the shore of Lake Peipus
with Tartu, a city in a neighboring county. Only one other road, Route 32, covers
this north-south route.

In the north, the E20 highway not only connects western counties to all major
settlements in Ida-Viru, e. g. Kothla-Järve, Jõhvi, Sillimäe and Narva, but also
leads to the only major bridge joining the country to Russia over a Narva river.

### Points of interest

Here are some probable locations for the conflict between the NSPR and BLUFOR.

#### North

With the population centres, mining operations and connection to the Gulf of
Finland in the north, this region is the most important to control.

##### E20

The E20 is part of the european road 20, connecting Ireland to Saint Petersburg.
It runs through all the major cities in Ida-Viru, which makes it invaluable for
troop transportation for either side of the conflict.

##### Kiviõli/Püssi

<img src="ressources/Kiviõli.png">

With the name literally being "oil shale" in estonian, it is no secret what
type of industry is prevalent in Kiviõli. After the dissolution of the USSR,
this town of 10.000 lost almost half of its inhabitants. A stronghold of
*Iseseisvus rahvale* support with the two ash hills, highest artificial points
in the entire baltics, towering over empty houses.

###### Aidu karjääri tööstusplats

A mine east of Püssi, wide open terrain with excellent train network. Used by
NSPR forces as a rallying place.

###### Ash Hills of Kiviõli oil factory

A sad landmark and constant reminder of former life in the USSR, these over
100m high hills were created by oil shale extraction.

##### Kohtla-Järve

<img src="ressources/Kohtla-Jarve.png">

Kothla-Järve is a large town in the centre of Ida-Viru, the fifth-largest in
Estonia. Established as a mining town in the 1920s, it is a key element in the
oil shale industry of Ida-Viru, making it a valuable target to NSPR forces.

##### Jõhvi

<img src="ressources/Jõhvi.png">

Another former mining town with declining population. Most buildings are typical
soviet blocks, and over 50% of the population are ethnically russian, with another
20% from other former eastern bloc countries. Other than similar, neighboring
towns, Jõhvi never developed any business to the same extend of oil shale mining, 
which led to a high level of unemployment.

Almost 92% of Jõhvi voted for independence, and it is home to many of *Iseseisvus*
*rahvale*'s most fierce supporters. Its vice president was born here, too.
