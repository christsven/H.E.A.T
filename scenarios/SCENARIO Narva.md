## Scenario introduction

### 2012 - Declining baltics

Several years of disinformation campaigns, civil unrest due to declining living
standards, and a feeling of being left out by the more ethnically estonian west
counties lead to the rise of extremist sentiment in the more eastern counties
of Estonia. As a former soviet republic, many older, russian-born citizens
remember the USSR in a positive light and see the westernization of society as
a mistake. Most of them live right at the border with Russia, for example in
the city of Narva (95.7% native russian speakers, 87.7% ethnic russians), right
at the border, many of whom face lower living standards due to not speaking estonian.

### 2014 - Steadfast Jazz Disaster

While tensions brew over the years, a far-right, nationalist movement consisting
of former Red Army soldiers, communist politicians and a growing disillusioned
voter base formed the *"Iseseisvus rahvale"* movement. This group was a vocal
minority in local politics seeking independence from Estonia to form a socialist
republic under a Sowjet in Narva.

The movement gained an influx in supporters and recognition after a military
excercise called "Steadfast Jazz" in November of 2013 lead to the crash of a
french Mirage F1 in a village with a civilian losses, an ethnically russian
farmer. The lackluster response of authorities and NATO commands belatedly
response, at first refusing to halt the maneuver, lead to a PR disaster for
NATO, fueling anti-west sentiment.

### 2015 - Spiraling protests

With reoccuring protests demanding more autonomy and accepting russian as a state
language, civil unrest grew over the course of couple of months in early 2015,
while thee refugee crisis fueled conservative populism. First open calls for 
independence followed razzias against popular far-right extremists, shortly before 
the election of parliament in March. The *"Iseseisvus rahvale"* party were elected 
by over 80% of voters in the Ida Viru county during the fraud allegation ridden election run. 
After learning about their victory, party officials announced an independence referendum
before the end of the year, which was sharply condemned by estonian and EU officials.

First clashes between paramilitary forces and police followed in March and April.
The death of two policemen made global news in early May. The estonian, lithuanian 
and latvian presidents called upon the treaty of the european union to aid against the
threat of a civil war. 

A bombing of a military convoi redeploying from an excercise in Sillamae in August
started a discussion to send peace keeping mission to Estonia.

### 2016 - Outbreak of war

## Geography

Ida Nivu lies at the russian-estonian land border as well as the Gulf of Finland in
the north. To the south-east, a large part of the border runs through lake Peipsi.
The terrain itself is largely flat with up to 30% composed of mires and bogs. These
areas cover open fields with muddy, almost swampy terrain and waist-high vegetation.
Additionally many small rivers and revines, some artificial, cover the landscape. While large parts are used for agriculture, there are still parts of forest and bushlands remaining.

With the population centres along the northern coast most other parts of the Ida-Nivu are
only compromised of small villages, connected by
