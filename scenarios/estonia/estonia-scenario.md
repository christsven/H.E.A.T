### 2016

#### Attack on Jõhvi Garrison

Garrison in a surprise attack. The garrison was used for infantry training and
is the home to the Viru Infantry Battalion, which was not prepared for the attack,
but fought valiantly.

#### Urban fighting in Kothla Järve

The bitter urban fighting for Kothla Järve, in some cases days on end over singular
streets and houses, culminated in a battle over the city hall alongside the Keskallee
in the city centre.

#### Skirmish at Tudulinna Dam

A disagreement between UN Peacekeepers and NSPR forces over control of the Tudulinna
dam led to a skirmish between the two.

### 2017

#### Bog raids

The decentralized logistical grid helped the NSPR against singular artillery strikes,
but made them susseptible against raid attacks via helicopter by the border guards.

#### Attack on convoi

A planned attack on an EUFOR convoi was widely televised as a propaganda tool.

#### Battle below the Ashen Hills

With the arrival of EUFOR troops, the estonian forces slowly pushed out NSPR holdouts
from the larger settlements, with a notable fight below the artificial hills of
the old oil shale excavation sites in Kivioli.

#### EUFOR port raid on Sillimäe

NAVEUFOR attacked Sillimäe port in a night campaign, securing a bridgehead
for reinforcements.

### 2018

#### Fight for Narva City

Reinforced by the NATO mission, the estonian army took back Narva city in a long
fight through the streets.

#### First battle for Balti power station

The large power plant south of Narva saw a coordinated attack by BASEP and
EUFOR, taking control of the facility and using it as a staging ground for the Narva
campaign.

#### Second Battle for Balti power station

Shortly after the loss of the first battle, NSPR forces started a counterattack on
the power station with boats and tanks.

#### Siege at Hermann Castle

The Narva City campaign was prolonged by a stronghold at the river itself
which was occupied by a NSPR company.

#### Last Stand

After losing most ground, the NSPR was defeated in a last battle for the Jõhvi garrison.
