## Scenario breakdown

Estonia is one of the three baltic countries, between Russia and the baltic sea.
Just to the north east, along the Gulf of Finland, sits Saint Petersburg, one of
Russias largest population and cultural centres. And right at that critical 20km
stretch of water to Russia's second largest cargo port and the mostly EU controlled
passings into the North Sea sits Ida Viru.

The estonian county shares not only a border, but also a sizable chunk of its
population with Russia. Narva, the third-largest city of Estonia, sits right on
that line between East and West. And after years of rising tensions, polarization
and political turmoil, Ida Viru decided to split off to form a new Republic, thus
plunging the tiny country of 1.3 million inhabitants into a civil war.

With a standing force of over ten thousand revolutionaries ranging from former
soldiers to armed civilians, and backed by a russian PMC, these separatists already
held out against the sizable estonian armed forces and their reserve pool as well
as an EU mission led by France.

Finally, after almost a year of fighting, attacks on EU countries forced a reaction
of NATO itself, but the United States' fresh and isolationist administration
refuses any aid. The West facing political and economical problems left and right
seems more divided than ever.

Russian troops are lining the border, remembering the annexation of Crimea three
years ago, no US troops in sight. A single misstep is all it takes.

## Event timeline

### Sowing the seeds

Ida Viru used to be a centre for oil shale excavation and processing as well as
nuclear research, being a wealthy part of the USSR during the Cold War. Many of
the workers came from Russia, and to this day remember the times of importance in
a nostalgic light. But with the breakup of the Soviet Union and establishment of
a sovereign state, the region fell from an important producer of oil shale as well
as enriched uranium into unimportance. With no other significant industry ever
seriously taking over, many fell into poverty and unemployment.

Another legacy of this period is the large ethnic russian population, especially
in the northern cities. Many living here never learned estonian, a stigma that did
not help when the employment rate plummeted and many lost their income. With the
rising tensions, a new party started to gain traction, the "_rahvaste iseseisvuspartei_".
The party garnered attention with controversial rethoric, demanding for example
more representation of ethnic russians in Estonia and presenting a general
anti-west stance.

The party's influence grew with the years, and tragedies such as a disaster during
a NATO excercise in 2014 were used for their advantage. A french Mirage fighter
jet went down on a farm in Ida Viru, killing an ethnic russian farmer. The
"Steadfast Jazz Disaster" becoming a major talking point in local politics. With
the annexation of Crimea, talks of more autonomy grew louder amongs RIP politicians.

The baltic states decided as a reaction to Crimea and the growing unrest along the
border counties to join their forces more broadly, to encourage cooperation and
unity among them. A new [border guard unit](#baltic-security-partnership-brigade) was established to patrol the swamps and
bogs, and to quickly deploy forces to remote parts of the sparsely populated forest
regions.

### Growing tensions

With the RIP gaining more and more political influence, the rethoric grew ever
more dividing, and protests became commonplace. Elections were held in March of
2015 where the RIP became the senior party in Ida Viru, talks of an independence
referendum were making the rounds. The county understood itself as a "de facto
autonomous country [sic]", as one member of the party declared in a press conference.
