</p>

## Scenario breakdown

Estonia is one of the three baltic countries. As the northernmost, it is situated
between Latvia, Russia and the baltic sea. Just to the north east along the Gulf of
Finland lays Saint Petersburg, Russias second largest population and cultural
centres. And right next the critical 20km wide connection of Russia's second
largest cargo port to the north sea sits the estonian county of Ida Viru. 
The region shares not only a border, but also a sizable chunk of its
population's ethnicity with Russia.

Now, after years of rising tensions, polarization and political turmoil, Ida Viru
splits off to form a new russian republic, plunging the tiny country of 1.3 million
inhabitants into a civil war.

With a standing force of over ten thousand revolutionaries ranging from former
soldiers to armed civilians, and backed by a russian PMC, these separatists already
held out against the sizable estonian armed forces and their reserve pool as well
as an EU mission led by France.

Finally, after almost a year of fighting, attacks on EU countries forced a reaction
of NATO itself, but the United States' fresh and isolationist administration
refuses any aid. The West facing political and economical problems left and right
seems more divided than ever.

Russian troops are lining the border, remembering the annexation of Crimea three
years ago, no US troops in sight. A single misstep is all it takes.

## Event timeline

### Sowing the seeds

Ida Viru used to be a centre for oil shale excavation and processing as well as
nuclear research, being a wealthy part of the USSR during the Cold War. Many of
the workers came from Russia, and to this day remember the times of importance in
a nostalgic light. But with the breakup of the Soviet Union and reestablishment of
a sovereign Estonia, the region faded from an important producer of oil shale as well
as enriched uranium into unimportance. With no other significant industry ever
seriously taking over, many fell into poverty and unemployment.

Another legacy of this period is the large ethnic russian population, especially
in the northern cities. Many living here never learned estonian, a stigma that did
not help when the employment rate plummeted and many lost their income. With the
rising tensions, a new party started to gain traction, the "_rahvaste iseseisvuspartei_".
The party garnered attention with controversial rethoric, demanding for example
more representation of ethnic russians in Estonia and presenting a general
anti-west stance.

The party's influence grew with the years, and tragedies such as a disaster during
a NATO excercise in 2014 were used for their advantage. A french Mirage fighter
jet went down on a farm in Ida Viru, killing an ethnic russian farmer. The
"Steadfast Jazz Disaster" becoming a major talking point in local politics. With
the annexation of Crimea, talks of more autonomy grew louder amongs RIP politicians.

The baltic states decided as a reaction to Crimea and the growing unrest along the
border counties to join their forces more broadly, to encourage cooperation and
unity among them. A new [border guard unit](#baltic-security-partnership-brigade) was established to patrol the swamps and
bogs, and to quickly deploy forces to remote parts of the sparsely populated forest
regions.

### Growing tensions

<p align=center>

</p>

With the RIP gaining more and more political influence, the rethoric grew ever
more dividing, and protests became commonplace. Elections were held in March of
2015 where the RIP became the senior party in Ida Viru, talks of an independence
referendum were making the rounds. The county understood itself as a "de facto
autonomous country [sic]", as one member of the party declared in a press conference.

Outside pressures forced the estonian government into accepting a third party as
an election observer, and as such a [UN peacekeeping operation](#un-mission-for-estonia) was established,
since the EU was not seen as as neutral enough. The forces stayed in the country
and  aided the local police in Ida Viru which struggled with dissent and increased
violence.

While the other baltic countries also struggled with similar situations in their
border counties, nowhere did it develop so rapidly as in Ida Viru. Yet still the
global awareness was quite low of the protests. Most media outlets where preoccupied
with flashier events, and the protests where largely ignored as smaller versions
of the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine.

### The referendum

After months of heated debates and several failed illegal attempts, the government
caved and allowed a referendum over more autonomy in legislation, though for many
this was more of an independence referendum than anything else.

While Estonia is a highly digitalized country where elections are usually held
online, the mistrust of pro-separatist voters led many to vote via direct,
personal voting. The voting booths were dotted around the county, guarded by
police forces and UNFIBAL peacekeepers, as well as russian observers that were
demanded by the Kremlin to monitor the referendum.

The results were proclaimed at the 31st of December, with a slim majority
voting against the reforms. After an initial sigh of relief, the celebrations
would quickly turn sour over the coming days.

The RIP party immediatly declared the results of the election to be invalid due
to vote tampering, as there was a large divergence between online results and the
voting booth results. Russian election observers claimed to have proof of this,
but before any serious investigations could be led, a storm of cyberattacks ground
the country to a halt at the same time as targeted misinformation flooded social media
channels. After several bomb attacks the government called out a state of emergency
and started troop reserve activation to aid police forces, but it was too late.
One night, three weeks into the new year, the country went up in flames.

### Crossing the rubicon

The garrisons of the armed forces in Ida Viru, mainly used for training of new
recruits, but also for the newly refurbished territorial defense units as well
as the Baltic Brigade, were hit simultanously. Across all of Estonia, bombs and
surprise attacks of small cells disabled bridges and important connections to
the east.

A provisional government in Narva was declared over television and radio, while
internet connections in large parts of eastern Europe were disrupted. The
[_Narva Socialist People's Republic_](#narva-socialist-peoples-republic) was proclaimed with the borders of the former
Ida Viru, and all crossings were to remain closed until further notice. But with
the threat of a civil war on everyones mind, most people fled westward and clogged
every street into Europe's youngest republic.

The refugees fleeing to the West overwhelmed peacekeeping forces, who tried
to keep the main roads and connections out of Ida Viru open. This hindered the
now mostly mobilized estonian armed forces from quickly intervening, as the few
intact roads were full of civilian cars.

The Kremlin heavily lobbied against any outside intervention and declared aerial
attacks against NSPR forces as a provocation and a reason for its own participation
in the conflict. Due to the already tense political situation in many european
nations, this was quietly accepted as a deescalatory agreement.

With the largest settlements under control, central points of interest for the
economical effort and logistical centres were taken swiftly to create a decentralized
net of holdouts for defense. Power stations, important crossroads, the north-south
connection to Tudulinna were a high priority. Former quarries and parts of the
national forests are used to hide equipment and house medical facilities for casualties.

Populist rethoric and disinformation campaigns lead to a polarized society in the
years prior, and those unsupportive of the political rethoric were driven
to move west. But not everyone had the monetary support necessary for such a 
drastic change in life. There still are parts of the population which did not
approve of the coup, and some even took to arms, forming small counter-revolutionary
cells. The majority of these people are enlisted in the volunteer structures of the
estonian forces.

While this was enough to gain control in some parts of the country, the many small
villages and settlements surrounding the cities were too many to be militarily
controlled.

### Baptism by Fire

Since NATO was unwilling to intervene in the "internal affairs of member states",
the EUs Foreign Affairs Council voted to send one of the two EU Battlegroups under
the [Common Security and Defense Policy](#eufor-estonia) (CSPD) to aid estonian forces.

Just two years prior, the force had been restructured following Brexit
and was still in a transitioning process. At the time of deployment,
the two battlegroups where led by Italy and France, and the french one was selected
to be deployed reinforced with the EUROCORPS.

In Estonia, the civil war had taken its toll on the country. After the initial gains
from NSPR forces and the jolty response of the estonian army, a drawnout fight
over control of key cities and passageways followed. Due to the de facto No Fly
Zone over Ida Viru, the ground offensives had to proceed more caucious and slow,
with NSPR defenders using the dense forests and few still usable streets into the
county to their advantage. Urban combat proved especially costly for the small army,
but the NSPR also had to suffer painful losses in irreplaceble equipment due to
BASEP raids into the lightly defended sites located in the national parks. Many
villages and farms lay in ruin after skirmishes, and terrorist cells routinely
performed attacks on military and logisical sites outside of Ida Viru.

While not targeted in the beginning of open conflict, the UNFIBAL peacekeepers
had to change their approach after a disagreement between a group of resistance
fighters attempted to take control of the Tudulinna dam, which deteriorated into
a drawnout skirmish between them.
The mission was further resupplied to also support the Estonial Defense League in
the rest of the country, who are primarily occupied dealing with the refugee
situation.

Even though the resistance suffered a hefty amount of attrition from fighting not
only against the estonian army, the baltic territorial defense and UNFIBAL personnel,
but now also the CSDP coalition, there was no noticable dip in ammunition or
equipment, which led to accusations of Russia providing heavy equipment to the
resistance fighters. This was not a very far fetched claim, since there was
literally no other direction from where the resistance could have gotten their
weapons in the first place, but russian officials always refused to acknowledge
any participation in the conflict.

### Divided Unity

With the help of EUFORs corps-sized land force, large parts of the west and north
were retaken over the course of the year. NSPR forces reverted to asymmetrical
fighting where necessary,but still held onto the eastern cities. The southern roads
are also either under NSPR control or in an unusable state, mined or destroyed.

Some cells, especially in the cities, became more radicalized than others due to
the heavy attrition during this campaign. After the fall of Kothla-Järve, several
individuals of defeated local defense teams were so consumed by this hatred, that
they turned to attacking the countries involved in the allied forces. Multiple huge
bombing attacks on garrisons in France and Italy as well as a failed IED truck
in Brussels held the West on edge for weeks. France as well as Italy invoked
Article 5 in response to the attacks, but especially the US administration held
back on support, since the US "[...] should not be required to pay for the defense
of countries who piggyback on US spending".

> *"Many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back,
> where they're delinquent as far as I'm concerned, because the United States has
> had to pay for them. So if you go back 10 or 20 years, you'll just add it all
> up, it's massive amounts of money is owed!"*

With the US internal politics devolving into chaos, the other members had to muster
up an operation of their own. The [VJTF](#nato-response-force) was sent as a first response, with initial
follow up units arriving shortly after.

</p>

<p align=center>

</p>

The **Estonian Land Forces** are the land component of the [Estonian Defence Forces](/factions/Estonian%20Land%20Forces.md)
(EDF), responsible for defending the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Estonia. They consist of around 3000 personnel during peacetimes, and is division-
sized with large parts only staffed by reserve units.

After the first clashes in 2014, a reactivation of reservist forces and more
thorough training started to fill back the ranks of the Estonian Division, similar
to the BSP Brigade. The restructuring under the *National Defence Development*
*Plan 2013-2022* had to be reworked to accelerate the force readiness and accomodate
the new armored forces sponsored by Poland, who became a partner with the Estonian
forces in a newly formed armoured Battalion.

In response to the degrading situation european allies began arms donations to
the army, especially Poland and Finland, where a large part of the estonian
vehicle fleet and weaponry originated from. Training on and with the new equipment
took place in polish bases, for example T-72M and T-72M1(R)s variants, as well as
BWP-1s for reservist mechanized infantry formations. Other shipments included
unarmoured vehicles for the border guards, weapons for activated reservists,
ammunition and logistical vehicles.

Finland came to a bilateral agreement of vehicle refurbishment and maintenance in
finnish territory, since the most used APC, the Sisu Parsi variants XA-170/XA-188,
are out of finnish production.

The **Baltic Security Partnership Brigade**, or [BASEP](/factions/Baltic%20Security%20Partnership%20Brigade.md),  was founded in 2014 as a
reaction to tension arrising in several counties of the baltic states at the
russian border. It was established as a combined brigade of all 3 state's ground
forces with the aim to signal cohesion and willingness to defend each other.

Mission goals include:

- Security in border regions
- Operations within national parks
- Low or non mechanized infantry operations

Some other properties of this light infantry include:

- Fast Deployment in swamp and bogs
- Modularity in equipment with NATO partners
- Interoperability with border guard units

With large parts of the estonian and lithuanian forces being either reservists,
volunteers and border guards, some of these structures were integrated into this
newly formed brigade. The brigade was structured as an air cavalry battalion
under lithuanian commandship.

Under the mission name [EUFOR Estonia](/factions/EUFOR%20Estonia%20Forces.md) fall one of the two EU battlegroups as well as the EUROCORPS. They are furthermore working in conjunction
with a naval force "EUNAVFOR Baltic Sea" composed of german and swedish frigates.

The EU Battlegroups are composed of around 1500 men each and are well established,
reoccuring formations in the biannual standby roster of battlegroups. The Eurocorps
routinely supports EU and EU member missions.

##### Franco-belgian Battlegroup

The battlegroup is led by french forces and supported by belgian formations.

##### EUROCORPS

The EUROCORPS is a multinational organisation consisting of a whole list of
pariticipants. The main body is made up of the franco-german brigade, its
headquarters is part of the nine NATO High Readiness Land Headquarters
(NATO HRF (L) HQ).

Formerly, the Corps had several belgian, german and french brigades permanently
associated with it. Since then, several new framework nations and associated
members joined and a more modular approach was introduced.

The Corps is involved as a headquarter element to the battlegroups and also
reinforced the EUBGs with units from the franco-german brigade.

Task Force Ida Viru Patch
</p>

The **Force des Nations unies chargée du maintien de la paix à l'Estonie** is a
United Nations [peacekeeping operation](/factions/UNFIBAL%20Forces.md) established in 2015. UN troops were largely
composed of bangladeshi forces, with some african nations like Rwanda, Ghana and
Egypt.

The mission aided in policing duties where normal police was no longer present
or completely overwhelmed, as well as security operations around critical
infrastructure. While some clashes did occur, most civilians received their
presence as a welcome help.

##### Main contributors and equipment during early crisis

Force composition of UNFIBAL forces consists mainly of bangladeshi, rwandan,
ghanaian and egyptian personnel. Other countries also contribute specialized
personnel or commanding officers, but the bulk of policing and security forces
come from those nations.

Their equipment is also provided by their consecutive armies, but european and
western nations did contribute vehicles, as their equipment is better suited for
the east european theatre.

This lead to a patchworked force with vehicles from all over the world, mostly
old and under-weaponized, since peacekeepers main focus is not lethal in nature.
Still, some security detachments for places of interest do have access to APCs
and IFVs, and a very small number of tanks was also provided.

#### Wartime contributors

After clashes forced UNFIBAL peacekeepers to divise a different plan of action,
initially most humanitarian and policing units assisted reservist formations and
NGOs in the rest of Estonia with refugee movement as well as organisation of
accomodation. Peacekeeping operations in Ida-Viru were organized in cooperation
with EUFOR command and later NATO command.

As an initial compromise in US politics, where less isolationist factions refused
to accept the neutral stance towards the attacks on NATO members the President had
taken, led to an arms deal with the UN forces, equipping them with more modern
vehicles, weaponry and personal equipment. This included prominently M1117
Guardian ASVs, M1120 Strkyer APCs as well as Bradley M2A2/A3 IFVs.

Operational goals during wartime changed a more proactive protection of the
civilian population, securing public infrastructure and upholding the rule of law
where possible, as well as documenting potential war crimes for later prosecussion.

#### NATO Response Force

While NATO of course exists as a mutual defense organization and its main armed
capabilities stem from armies of all member states, there are also several units
specifically for immediate deployment.

The most mobile of all is the "Very High Readiness Joint Task Force" which is
able to deploy in less than two days, which is then supplemented by "Follow-On"
units of a slightly lower readiness.

During the time of deployment, the [Panzergrenadierbrigade 37](/factions/German%20VJTF%20Panzergrenadier%20Division.md) „Freistaat Sachsen"
held the VJTF position and was sent to Estonia, followed up by more german
units, as well as other quickly deployable european armies.

</p>

<p align=center>
A Bratstwa PMC group patch found on a POW, 2017
</p>

The **Narva Socialist People's Republic** has a [standing force](/factions/NSPR%20Volunteer%20Rifle%20Contingent.md) of around 10-13.000
personnel, which serve under the umbrella of the NSPR flag. The larger core army
is composed of all kinds of citizens, from farmers to former military personel,
and they are further reinforced by a russian PMC.

The "Bratstwa" far-right, russian-nationalistic militia is the best equipped part
of the force. Their leader, Roman Sokolov, is a wealthy oligarch with ties to the
Kremlin. Most personnel enjoyed a thorough paramilitary training and their
equipment pool is modern. The entire force is estimated to consist of about
2000-2500 men, though some parts are also active in other parts of the world.

In contrast to Bratstwa stands the majority of NSPR soldiers, which consist of
more left-leaning, mostly ethnic russian estonians, which are fighting for anything
between a sovereign, communist state, just more autonomy, frustration and pure
hartred for the West. These people come from diverse backgrounds, some have former
military training, like the soviet mandatory service or come from a estonian armed
forces background. Most have no real prior experience at all and were trained
covertly in NSPR training camps throughout the county.

The vehicle pool is a mix of former soviet equipment, some stolen western/estonian
armed forces materiell, small amounts of modern russian weaponry and just reworked
civilian technicals. Additionally, some civilian drones are used for surveillance,
as IED carriers or suicide drones.
