# Breakaway Socialist Republic of Narva

![estonia map](/scenarios/ressources/estonia-map.excalidraw.png)

## Scenario introduction

This is the first setting for H.E.A.T. as a modern, fictional war in northern
europe. If you play this just as a unit roster for an army, a single match, or a
full campaign is up to you.

### Breakdown

A revolution in the eastern district of Ida Viru in Estonia plunged the small baltic
country into a civil war. Many of the larger settlements were swiftly taken under
control of the Narva Socialist People's Republic (NSPR), which has a standing force
of around 10-13.000 men.

The NSPR Forces are a patchwork of former soldiers, poorly prepared civilians and
paramilitary groups, which are as differently trained as they are equipped, making
use of old soviet equiment, civilian vehicles and more modern weaponry sponsored
by foreign donors. Ideologically just as split, the NSPR is internally divided
between left-leaning revolutionaries seeking their own state and far right militias
such as "Bratstwa", who want to become part of the Russian Federation.

Continued fighting already pulled the EU and the UN into the conflict, and after
terrorist attacks in several participating countries NATO is deploying forces as
well. With the US glaringly missing from their ranks due to internal struggles,
NATO seems weaker than ever.

The Russian Federation has condemned the use of NATO troops without a UN mandate
and threatens to send their own force in an effort to protect ethnic russians in
the region.

### Timetable

#### 2012 - Declining baltics

Several years of disinformation campaigns, civil unrest due to declining living
standards, and a feeling of being left out by the more economically prosperous
western counties lead to the rise of extremist sentiment in the more eastern
counties of Estonia. As a former soviet republic, many older, russian-born
citizens remember the USSR in a positive light and see the decline of industrial
sites in Ida Viru as a failure to keep the region relevant by the government.

Especially in the larger settlements, a majority of citizens come from other parts
of the former USSR, for example in the city of Narva (95.7% native russian
speakers, 87.7% ethnic russians) right at the border, many of whom face lower
living standards due to not speaking estonian.

#### 2014 - Steadfast Jazz Disaster

Without much change in sight, a far-right, nationalist movement consisting
of former Red Army soldiers, communist politicians and a small, vocal voter
base formed the *"Iseseisvus rahvale"* movement. This group started as a small
opposition minority in local politics seeking drastic change, even independence
from Estonia to go back to socialist times, when the region was an industrial centre
for oil shale excavation and nuclear research. These industries barely exist
anymore, but no new market ever took over.

The movement gained an influx in supporters after a military excercise called
"Steadfast Jazz" in November of 2013 lead to the crash of a french Mirage F1
in a village with a civilian losses, an ethnically russian farmer.

The lackluster response of authorities and NATO commands belatedly
response, at first refusing to halt the maneuver, lead to a PR disaster for
NATO, fueling anti-west sentiment.

As a reaction to the annexation of Crimea, the baltic states increased the budgets
for the large reservist and volunteer forces of their respective armed forces.
Furthermore, a combined [border guard unit](#baltic-security-partnership) of all baltic states was established
as a sign of unison and resolve against russian aggression and dissent
in not only the estonian, but also the other baltic border counties with Russia.

#### 2015 - Spiraling protests

With reoccuring protests demanding more autonomy and accepting russian as a state
language, civil unrest grew over the course of couple of months in early 2015,
while the refugee crisis fueled conservative populism. First open calls for
independence followed razzias against popular far-right extremists, shortly before
the election of parliament in March.

At the request of the estonian government, the UN aided in the execution and oversight
during the election, which was demanded by IV politicians and a Russian Federation
spokesperson. This established a [UN peacekeeping operation](#unfibal) to streamline the process
and create a more permanent presence in Estonia.

The *Iseseisvus rahvale* party were elected by a majority of voters in the Ida
Viru and other bordering counties during the election run.

After learning about their victory, party officials announced an independence
referendum before the end of the year. This was sharply condemned by estonian and
EU officials, leading to protests in both Ida Viru and the rest of the country.

First clashes between paramilitary forces and police followed in March and April.
The death of two policemen made global news in early May. The estonian, lithuanian
and latvian presidents called upon the treaty of the european union to aid against
the threat of a civil war, but media outlets were too preoccupied with the
"migrant crisis" in the EU, which overshadowed the events.

Similar dissenting discourse also slowly grew in other baltic countries, and while
not nearly as powerful as in Estonia, this helped to normalize the clashes and protests
in the eyes of the media. For many, this was just the smaller version to the Maidan
protests and clashes in Ukraine.

##### The referendum

After months of heated debates and several failed illegal attempts, the government
caved and allowed a referendum over more autonomy in legislation, though for many
this was more of an independence referendum than anything else.

While Estonia is a highly digitalized country where elections are usually held
online, the mistrust of pro-separatist voters led many to vote via direct,
personal voting. The voting booths were dotted around the county, guarded by
police forces and UNFIBAL peacekeepers, as well as russian observers the russian
state pressured Estonia into allowing to monitor the referendum.

The results were proclaimed at the 31st of December, with a slim majority
voting against the reforms. But celebrations would quickly turn sour over the
coming days.

#### 2016 - Outbreak of war

<p align=center>
Attacks on garrisons plunge the country into civil war, 2016
</p>

The IV party immediatly declared the results of the election to be invalid due
to vote tampering, as there was a large difference between online results and the
voting booth results. Russian election observers claimed to have proof of this,
but before any serious investigations could be led, a storm of cyberattacks ground
the country to a halt at the same time as targeted misinformation flooded social media
channels. After several bomb attacks the government called out a state of emergency
and started troop reserve activation to aid police forces, but it was too late.
One night, three weeks into the new year, the country went up in flames.

The garrisons of the armed forces in Ida Viru, mainly used for training of new
recruits, but also for the newly refurbished territorial defense units as well
as the Baltic Brigade, were hit simultanously. Across all of Estonia, bombs and
surprise attacks of small cells disabled bridges and important connections to
the east.

A provisional government in Narva was declared over television and radio, while
internet connections in large parts of eastern Europe were disrupted. The
_Narva Socialist People's Republic_ was proclaimed with the borders of the former
Ida Viru, and all crossings were to remain closed until further notice. But with
the threat of a civil war on everyones mind, most people fled westward and clogged
every street into Europe's youngest republic.

Refugees fleeing to the West quickly overwhelmed peacekeeping forces, who tried
to keep the main roads and connections out of Ida Viru open. This hindered the
now mostly mobilized estonian armed forces from quickly intervening, as the few
intact roads were full of civilian cars.

The Kremlin heavily lobbied against a NATO intervention and declared any aerial
attacks against NSPR forces as a provocation and a reason for its own participation
in the conflict. Due to the already tense political situation in many european
nations, this was accepted as a deescalatory agreement.

##### Situation in Ida Viru

With the largest settlements under control, central POI for the economical effort
and logistical centres were taken swiftly to create a decentralized net of holdouts
for assymetrical defense. Power stations, important crossroads, the north-south
connection to Tudulinna were a high priority. Former quarries and parts of the
national forests are used to hide equipment and house medical facilities for
casualties.

Populist rethoric and disinformation campaigns lead to a polarized society in the
years prior, and those unsupportive of the political rethoric were driven 
to move west. But not everyone had the monetary support necessary for such a 
drastic change in life. There still are parts of the population which did not
approve of the coup, and some even took to arms, forming small counter-revolutionary
cells. The majority of these people are enlisted in the volunteer structures of the
estonian forces.

While this was enough to gain control in some parts of the country, the many small
villages and settlements surrounding the cities were too many to be militarily
controlled.

##### Baptism by Fire

Since NATO was unwilling to intervene in the "internal affairs of member states",
the EUs Foreign Affairs Council voted to send one of the two EU Battlegroups under
the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSPD) to aid estonian forces.

Just two years prior, the force had been restructured following Brexit
and was still in a transitioning process. At the time of deployment,
the two battlegroups where led by Italy and France, and the french one was selected
to be deployed reinforced with the EUROCORPS.

In Estonia, the civil war had taken its toll on the country. After the initial gains
from NSPR forces and the jolty response of the estonian army, a drawnout fight
over control of key cities and passageways followed. Due to the de facto No Fly
Zone over Ida Viru, the ground offensives had to proceed more caucious and slow,
with NSPR defenders using the dense forests and few still usable streets into the
county to their advantage. Urban combat proved especially costly for the small army,
but the NSPR also had to suffer painful losses in irreplaceble equipment due to
BASEP raids into the lightly defended sites located in the national parks. Many
villages and farms lay in ruin after skirmishes, and terrorist cells routinely
performed attacks on military and logisical sites outside of Ida Viru.

While not targeted in the beginning of open conflict, the UNFIBAL peacekeepers
had to change their approach after a disagreement between a group of resistance
fighters attempted to take control of the Tudulinna dam, which deteriorated into
a drawnout skirmish between them.
The mission was further resupplied to also support the Estonial Defense League in
the rest of the country, who are primarily occupied dealing with the refugee
situation.

##### Reinforced resistance

<p align=center>

</p>

Even though the resistance suffered a hefty amount of attrition from fighting not
only against the estonian army, the baltic territorial defense and UNFIBAL personnel,
but now also the CSDP coalition, there was no noticable dip in ammunition or
equipment, which led to accusations of Russia providing heavy equipment to the
resistance fighters. This was not a very far fetched claim, since there was
literally no other direction from where the resistance could have gotten their
weapons in the first place, but russian officials always refused to acknowledge
any participation in the conflict.

#### 2017 - Divided Unity

The EUFOR battlegroup managed to crack the lines in the west and retake large
amounts of territory, with drawnout figthing in the cities for in some cases
singular streets. NSPR forces reverted to asymmetrical fighting where necessary,
but still held onto the eastern cities. The southern roads are also either under
NSPR control or in an unusable state, mined or destroyed.

Some cells, especially in the cities, became more radicalized than others due to
the heavy attrition during this campaign. After the fall of Kothla-Järve, several
individuals of defeated local defense teams were so consumed by this hatred, that
they turned to attacking the countries involved in the EUBGs. Multiple huge
bombing attacks on garrisons in France and Italy as well as a failed IED truck
in Brussels held the West on edge for weeks. France as well as Italy invoked
Article 5 in response to the attacks, but especially the US administration held
back on support, since the US "[...] should not be required to pay for the defense
of countries who piggyback on US spending".

> *"Many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back,
> where they're delinquent as far as I'm concerned, because the United States has
> had to pay for them. So if you go back 10 or 20 years, you'll just add it all
> up, it's massive amounts of money is owed!"*

With the US internal politics devolving into chaos, european states had to muster
up an operation of their own. The VJTF was sent as a first response, with initial
follow up units arriving shortly after.

### Participating forces

#### Estonian Land Forces

<p align=center>
First Estonian Division Insignia
</p>

The **Estonian Land Forces** are the land component of the Estonian Defence Forces
(EDF), responsible for defending the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Estonia. They consist of around 3000 personnel during peacetimes, and is division-
sized with large parts only staffed by reserve units.

After the first clashes in 2014, a reactivation of reservist forces and more
thorough training started to fill back the ranks of the Estonian Division, similar
to the BSP Brigade. The restructuring under the *National Defence Development*
*Plan 2013-2022* had to be reworked to accelerate the force readiness and accomodate
the new armored forces sponsored by Poland, who became a partner with the Estonian
forces in a newly formed armoured Battalion.

In response to the degrading situation european allies began arms donations to
the army, especially Poland and Finland, where a large part of the estonian
vehicle fleet and weaponry originated from. Training on and with the new equipment
took place in polish bases, for example T-72M and T-72M1(R)s variants, as well as
BWP-1s for reservist mechanized infantry formations. Other shipments included
unarmoured vehicles for the border guards, weapons for activated reservists,
ammunition and logistical vehicles.

Finland came to a bilateral agreement of vehicle refurbishment and maintenance in
finnish territory, since the most used APC, the Sisu Parsi variants XA-180/XA-188,
are out of finnish production.

BASEP Bridage Insignia
</p>

The **Baltic Security Partnership Brigade**, or BASEP,  was founded in 2014 as a
reaction to tension arrising in several counties of the baltic states at the
russian border. It was established as a combined brigade of all 3 state's ground
forces with the aim to signal cohesion and willingness to defend each other.

Mission goals include:

- Security in border regions
- Operations within national parks
- Low or non mechanized infantry operations

Some other properties of this light infantry include:

- Fast Deployment in swamp and bogs
- Modularity in equipment with NATO partners
- Interoperability with border guard units

With large parts of the estonian and lithuanian forces being either reservists,
volunteers and border guards, some of these structures were integrated into this
newly formed brigade. The brigade was structured as an air cavalry battalion
under lithuanian commandship.

<p align=center>
Task Force Ida Viru Patch
</p>

The **Force des Nations unies chargée du maintien de la paix à l'Estonie** is a
United Nations peacekeeping operation established in 2015. UN troops were largely
composed of bangladeshi forces, with some african nations like Rwanda, Ghana and
Egypt.

The mission aided in policing duties where normal police was no longer present
or completely overwhelmed, as well as security operations around critical
infrastructure. While some clashes did occur, most civilians received their
presence as a welcome help.

##### Main contributors and equipment during early crisis

Force composition of UNFIBAL forces consists mainly of bangladeshi, rwandan,
ghanaian and egyptian personnel. Other countries also contribute specialized
personnel or commanding officers, but the bulk of policing and security forces
come from those nations.

Their equipment is also provided by their consecutive armies, but european and
western nations did contribute vehicles, as their equipment is better suited for
the east european theatre.

This lead to a patchworked force with vehicles from all over the world, mostly
old and under-weaponized, since peacekeepers main focus is not lethal in nature.
Still, some security detachments for places of interest do have access to APCs
and IFVs, and a very small number of tanks was also provided.

#### Wartime contributors

After clashes forced UNFIBAL peacekeepers to divise a different plan of action,
initially most humanitarian and policing units assisted reservist formations and
NGOs in the rest of Estonia with refugee movement as well as organisation of
accomodation. Peacekeeping operations in Ida-Viru were organized in cooperation
with EUFOR command and later NATO command.

As an initial compromise in US politics, where less isolationist factions refused
to accept the neutral stance towards the attacks on NATO members the President had
taken, led to an arms deal with the UN forces, equipping them with more modern
vehicles, weaponry and personal equipment. This included prominently M1117
Guardian ASVs, M1120 Strkyer APCs as well as Bradley M2A2/A3 IFVs.

Operational goals during wartime changed a more proactive protection of the
civilian population, securing public infrastructure and upholding the rule of law
where possible, as well as documenting potential war crimes for later prosecussion.

#### EUFOR Estonia

Common Security and Defense Policy, EU
</p>

Under the mission name [EUFOR Estonia](/factions/EUFOR%20Estonia%20Forces.md) fall one of the two EU battlegroups as
well as the EUROCORPS. They are furthermore working in conjunction with a naval
force "EUNAVFOR Baltic Sea" composed of german and swedish frigates.

The EU Battlegroups are composed of around 1500 men each and are well established,
reoccuring formations in the biannual standby roster of battlegroups. The Eurocorps
routinely supports EU and EU member missions.

##### Franco-belgian Battlegroup

The battlegroup is led by french forces and supported by belgian formations.

##### EUROCORPS

The EUROCORPS is a multinational organisation consisting of a whole list of
pariticipants. The main body is made up of the franco-german brigade, its
headquarters is part of the nine NATO High Readiness Land Headquarters
(NATO HRF (L) HQ).

Formerly, the Corps had several belgian, german and french brigades permanently
associated with it. Since then, several new framework nations and associated
members joined and a more modular approach was introduced.

The Corps is involved as a headquarter element to the battlegroups and also
reinforced the EUBGs with units from the franco-german brigade.

#### NATO

##### VJTF & I-F/I-FU

</p>

While NATO of course exists as a mutual defense organization and its main armed
capabilities stem from armies of all member states, there are also several units
specifically for immediate deployment.

The most mobile of all is the "Very High Readiness Joint Task Force" which is
able to deploy in less than two days, which is then supplemented by "Follow-Up"
units of a slightly lower readiness.

During the time of deployment, the Panzergrenadierbrigade 37 „Freistaat Sachsen"
held the VJTF position and was sent to Estonia, followed up by more german
units, as well as other quickly deployable european armies.

### Opposing Force

#### NSPR

<p align=center>
A Bratstwa PMC group patch found on a POW, 2017
</p>

The **Narva Socialist People's Republic** has a standing force of around 10-13.000
personnel, which serve under the umbrella of the NSPR flag. The larger core army
is composed of all kinds of citizens, from farmers to former military personel,
and they are further reinforced by a russian PMC.

The "Bratstwa" far-right, russian-nationalistic militia is the best equipped part
of the force. Their leader, Roman Sokolov, is a wealthy oligarch with ties to the
Kremlin. Most personnel enjoyed a thorough paramilitary training and their
equipment pool is modern. The entire force is estimated to consist of about
2000-2500 men, though some parts are also active in other parts of the world.

In contrast to Bratstwa stands the majority of NSPR soldiers, which consist of
more left-leaning, mostly ethnic russian estonians, which are fighting for anything
between a sovereign, communist state, just more autonomy, frustration and pure
hartred for the West. These people come from diverse backgrounds, some have former
military training, like the soviet mandatory service or come from a estonian armed
forces background. Most have no real prior experience at all and were trained
covertly in NSPR training camps throughout the county.

The vehicle pool is a mix of former soviet equipment, some stolen western/estonian
armed forces materiell, small amounts of modern russian weaponry and just reworked
civilian technicals. Additionally, some civilian drones are used for surveillance,
as IED carriers or suicide drones.
