## Factions

Rules with basic factions for BLUFOR and INDEPENDENT in /factions
*OPFOR rules are still WIP.*

Units are described in a table as seen below:

| Unit name |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost | Cost by veterancy |
| Setup | NCO ( Weapon ) |
| Reinforcement | Cost per additional unit |
|Options|Rules: <ul><li>Item one.</li><li>Item two.</li></ul>Weapons: <ul><li>Item one.</li><li>Item two.</li></ul>|
| Special Rules|Unit Rules: <ul><li>Item one.</li><li>Item two.</li></ul>Optional: <ul><li>Item one.</li><li>Item two.</li></ul> |

Additionally, the following table is used for vehicles, as seen below.
To better represent the sheer amount of modern vehicle variants, many
vehicles have replacement options for their main weapon system, or can
even be fielded without any at all.

| :---- | :---- |
| Cost | Cost by veterancy |
| Damage Value | NCO ( Weapon ) |
