This is meant as an expansion of Bolt Action rules, so only additions or in a few
cases rebalanced rules are provided. Everything else can be found in the
Bolt Action rulebook.

>This ruleset currently expands on the v3 ruleset. Since it initially was written
>for v2, some phrasing might be a bit off, but I think everything should work fine.
>If you find anything, just let me know.

represent the sheer amount of modern vehicle variants, many vehicles have
