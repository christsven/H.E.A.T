# T+1: Gefechtsstand

|DTG|182300Zapr16|

## Scenario

A german command and control post in Aseri was chosen as a target for a combined land and sea incursion by NSPR forces. The Gefechtsstand at the site is used for artillery coordination from the nearby Frigate "Rheinland-Pfalz" (F225), which provides fire support for the northern attack formations along the E20 towards Kõthla-Järve. The command post is highly mobile and able to relocate in minutes, but taken off-guard by the surprise attack. Now the vulnerable truck is stuck with a small platoon of infantry in the logistics hub and waiting for rescue.

Onboard the Rheinland Pfalz is a Bordeinsatzkompanie of the Seebataillon, a german marine infantry contingent. Trained for sea landings and rescue operations, they are a valuable asset with their speedboats. They dispatched as soon as they noticed the attackers approaching and are minutes away from breaching shore.

## Gameplay

NATO forces are allowed to be stationed 30" from the centre of the map. NSPR forces start 10" along the table edge. All boats start in reserve.

### Scenario rules

### Goals

#### NATO/VJTF



|Condition|Points|
|:---|----|
|Points per destroyed enemy unit|1 VP|
|Points per round the Gefechtsstand survives|0.5 VP|
|Points for getting the Gefechtsstand offmap|3 VP|

#### NSPR

Either destroy the HQ and cripple the ship artillery for a while to halt the enemy in the north, or capture the truck to sell it for much needed ammunition and supplies eastwards. Even just getting some of the information contained in the trucks would be a small win, as it would disrupt encryption and communication for the northern attack formations.

|Condition|Points|
|:---|----|
|Points per destroyed enemy unit|1 VP|
|Points for destruction of Gefechtsstand|3 VP|
|Points for extracting information|2 VP|
|Points for stealing the Gefechtsstand|5 VP|
